            How does enforcement of labour regulations shape the labour market effects of trade? We combine local economic shocks generated by the unilateral trade liberalisation in Brazil and enforcement variation across regions to show that regions with stricter enforcement observed: (i) lower informality; (ii) larger losses in overall employment; (iii) greater reductions in the number of formal plants. Regions with weaker enforcement experienced opposite effects. All these effects are concentrated on low-skill workers. Our results indicate that greater flexibility introduced by informality allows both formal firms and low-skill workers to cope better with adverse labour market shocks.},

@article{witte_job_2018,
	title = {Job Referrals and Strategic Network Formation},
	abstract = {In this paper, I study the behavioural motivations underlying job referral decisions. In a ﬁeld experiment in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, I show that when choosing who to refer for a job, individuals trade off personal beneﬁts and altruistic considerations, with important implications for the efﬁciency and equity of the referral process. Using complete data on urban social networks and generating a panel of real work and referral opportunities over multiple sessions, I ﬁrst show that workers rely on reciprocity. This leads to both signiﬁcant on-the-job productivity losses and persistence in the exclusion of less connected individuals. This dynamic reciprocity is reduced under incentivised referrals, where workers are paid according to the output of their referral, which makes them screen more productive workers. Second, I ﬁnd that peripheral workers use job referrals strategically to enlarge their network: they are more likely to establish new and reciprocated links, with connections persisting after 18 months. I show that these ﬁndings are consistent with a network-based job referral model where individuals trade off social payoffs and altruistic considerations. My ﬁndings suggest that conventional job referrals through social networks can reinforce labour market inequalities and prevent less socially connected individuals from getting access to jobs. However, when given referral opportunities, these individuals can manage to escape exclusion even in the long-run. Policy-makers could exploit this and provide subsidised temporary jobs as linking opportunities, with the goal of alleviating long-term youth unemployment.},

For economies with significant informal sectors, business cycle fluctuations and labor market policy interventions can have important effects not only on the unemployment rate, but also on the allocation of workers across regulated and unregulated jobs. In this paper, using worker flows data from Brazil, we build, calibrate, and simulate a two-sector search and matching labor market model, in which firms have the choice of hiring workers formally or informally. We show that our model can explain well the main cyclical patterns that lead to those cyclical reallocations. We also show how the effect of government interventions in the labor market depend on the magnitude of the reallocation of labor across regulated and unregulated sectors. For our calibration, policies that decrease the cost of formal jobs, or increase the cost of informality, raise the share of formal employment while reducing unemployment.},

It covers a comprehensive body of research that ranges from well-identiﬁed experimental studies to equilibrium macro models, and more recently includes structural models that integrate both micro and macro eﬀects. The results available in the literature indicate that lowering the costs of formality is not an effective policy to reduce informality but may generate positive aggregate eﬀects, such as higher output and {TFP}. The most eﬀective formalisation policy is to increase enforcement on the extensive margin but not on the intensive margin of informality. The former generates substantial gains in aggregate {TFP} and output, without necessarily increasing unemployment. However, the overall welfare impacts are likely to depend on the transitional dynamics between steady states, which remains as an open area for future research.},

We do this by comparing an intervention that improves the ability to signal skills (the “job application workshop”) to a transport subsidy treatment designed to reduce the cost of job search. In the short run, both interventions have large positive effects on the probability of finding a formal job. The workshop also increases the probability of having a stable job with an open-ended contract. Four years later, the workshop significantly increases earnings, job satisfaction, and employment duration, but the effects of the transport subsidy have dissipated. Gains are concentrated on individuals who generally have worse labour market outcomes. Overall, our findings highlight that young people possess valuable skills that are unobservable to employers. Making these skills observable generates earnings gains that are far greater than the cost of the intervention.},
