# ECON0024-Notes

## Description

Github backup of latex source codes for ECON0024 Notes (AY 2022/3).

## About the Project

This LaTeX project intends to develop unofficial lecture notes for [ECON0024 Economic Policy Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/study/undergraduate/module-list/economic-policy-analysis-econ0024) taught in UCL BSc Economics programme.

Authors:

Xiaotian Tian (All Chapters excluding Health and Migration)

Kuangjie Ni (Health and Migration Chapters)

Kaicheng Lu (Health Chapter)

Haruka Shuei (who agreed to write one chapter but eventually didn't lol :bird:).

## How to Use?

You can simply download the [output PDF](main.pdf), clone and compile using a local TeX compiler, or import this to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

I guess no one will actually do this -- for anyone from the next cohort: you are more than welcomed if you want to take this over!

## About the Module

I do have some personal suggestions.. you can contact me directly if interested.
