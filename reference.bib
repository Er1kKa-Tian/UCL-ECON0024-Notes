	abstract = {In October 1999, the working families' tax credit ({WFTC}) replaced family credit as the main package of in-work support for families with children. Among a range of stated aims, the {WFTC} is intended to‘… improve work incentives, encouraging people without work to move into employment'. In this paper, we consider the impact of {WFTC} on hours and participation. To simulate labour supply responses, we use a discrete behavioural model of household labour supply with controls for fixed and childcare costs, and unobserved heterogeneity. In simulation, we experiment with a number of scenarios regarding the take-up of the credit, entry wage level and hourly childcare price. We find participation rates among single mothers to increase by around 2.2 percentage points for the base-case scenario, while for married women participation rates are modelled to fall. Our simulation results indicate a small increase in overall participation of around 30,000 individuals.},

While both Britain and the {US} have witnessed secular increases in 90/10 male earnings inequality over the last three decades, this measure of inequality in net family income has declined in Britain while it has risen in the {US}. To better understand these comparisons, we examine the interaction between labour market earnings in the family, assortative mating, the tax and welfare-benefit system and household income inequality. We find that both countries have witnessed sizeable changes in employment which have primarily occurred on the extensive margin in the {US} and on the intensive margin in Britain. Increases in the generosity of the welfare system in Britain played a key role in equalizing net income growth across the wage distribution, whereas the relatively weak safety net available to non-workers in the {US} mean this growing group has seen particularly adverse developments in their net incomes.},

	abstract = {A recent literature has constructed top income shares time series over the long run for more than twenty countries using income tax statistics. Top incomes represent a small share of the population but a very significant share of total income and total taxes paid. Hence, aggregate economic growth per capita and Gini inequality indexes are sensitive to excluding or including top incomes. We discuss the estimation methods and issues that arise when constructing top income share series,
including income definition and comparability over time and across countries, tax avoidance, and tax evasion. We provide a summary of the key empirical findings. Most countries experience a dramatic drop in top income shares in the first part of the twentieth century in general due to shocks to top capital incomes during
the wars and depression shocks. Top income shares do not recover in the immediate postwar decades. However, over the last thirty years, top income shares have increased substantially in English speaking countries and in India and China but not in continental European countries or Japan. This increase is due in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. As a result, wage income
comprises a larger fraction of top incomes than in the past. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and empirical models that have been proposed to account for the facts and the main questions that remain open. ({JEL} D31, D63, H26, N30)},

	doi = {10.1353/eca.2013.0000},
	abstract = {We show that the vast majority of very high-achieving students who are low-income do not apply to any selective college or university. This is despite the fact that selective institutions would often cost them less, owing to generous financial aid, than the resource-poor two-year and non-selective four-year institutions to which they actually apply. Moreover, high-achieving, low-income students who do apply to selective institutions are admitted and graduate at high rates. We demonstrate that these low-income students' application behavior differs greatly from that of their high-income counterparts who have similar achievement. The latter group generally follows the advice to apply to a few "par" colleges, a few "reach" colleges, and a couple of "safety" schools. We separate the low-income, high-achieving students into those whose application behavior is similar to that of their high-income counterparts ("achievement-typical" behavior) and those whose apply to no selective institutions ("income-typical" behavior). We show that income-typical students do not come from families or neighborhoods that are more disadvantaged than those of achievement-typical students. However, in contrast to the achievement-typical students, the income-typical students come from districts too small to support selective public high schools, are not in a critical mass of fellow high achievers, and are unlikely to encounter a teacher or schoolmate from an older cohort who attended a selective college. We demonstrate that widely-used policies-college admissions staff recruiting, college campus visits, college access programs-are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students, and we suggest policies that will be effective must depend less on geographic concentration of high achievers.},

Relying on quasi-experimental methods and synthetic control comparison groups, this article presents the effects of this state-mandated college entrance exam testing. Based on both state- and individual-level analyses, I find evidence that entrance exam policies were associated with increases in overall college enrollment in Illinois and that such policies re-sorted students in all three states between different types of institutions. In particular, Colorado saw an increase in enrollment at private 4-year institutions, whereas Illinois and Maine both saw a decrease in enrollment at pubic 2-year institutions. Increases in enrollment at schools that require entrance exams for admissions support the hypothesis that lack of exam scores can present barriers to college entry.},

The key finding of this study is that the effects of shadow education are substantively different across propensity strata and that its effects increase as the propensity to participate in shadow education increases. That is, those who are more likely to use shadow education, who are socioeconomically advantaged and possess higher educational capital, benefit more from shadow education than those who are less likely to use it. Moreover, use of public resources neither alleviates the effects of shadow education nor changes the pattern of the heterogeneous effects of shadow education based on likelihood of use.},

In all the data sets, the {SAT} showed incremental validity over secondary school grades in predicting subsequent academic performance, and this incremental relationship was not substantially affected by controlling for {SES}. The {SES} of enrolled students was very similar to that of specific schools' applicant pools, which suggests that the barrier to college for low-{SES} students in the United States is a lower rate of entering the college admissions process, rather than exclusion on the part of colleges.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, the average college has not become more selective: the reverse is true, though not dramatically. People who believe that college selectivity is increasing may be extrapolating from the experience of a small number of colleges such as members of the Ivy League, Stanford, Duke, and so on. These colleges have experienced rising selectivity, but their experience turns out to be the exception rather than the rule. Only the top 10 percent of colleges are substantially more selective now than they were in 1962. Moreover, at least 50 percent of colleges are substantially less selective now than they were in 1962. To understand changing selectivity, we must focus on how the market for college education has re-sorted students among schools as the costs of distance and information have fallen. In the past, students' choices were very sensitive to the distance of a college from their home, but today, students, especially high-aptitude students, are far more sensitive to a college's resources and student body. It is the consequent re-sorting of students among colleges that has, at once, caused selectivity to rise in a small number of colleges while simultaneously causing it to fall in other colleges. This has had profound implications for colleges' resources, tuition, and subsidies for students. I demonstrate that the stakes associated with choosing a college are greater today than they were four decades ago because very selective colleges are offering very large per-student resources and per-student subsidies, enabling admitted students to make massive human capital investments.},

This paper surveys major developments since then: the introduction of the “Scholastic Aptitude Test” in 1926, designed to tap students’ general analytic ability; E.F. Lindquist’s creation of the {ACT} in 1959 as a competitor to the {SAT}, intended as a measure of achievement rather than ability; the renewed interest on the part of some leading colleges and universities in subject-specific assessments such as the {SAT} Subject Tests and Advanced Placement exams; and current efforts to adapt K-12 standards-based tests for use in college admissions. Looking back at the evolution of admissions tests, it is evident that we have come full circle to a renewed appreciation for the value of achievement tests. The original College Boards started out as achievement tests, designed to assess students’ mastery of collegepreparatory subjects. A century of admissions testing has taught us that this initial premise may have been sounder than anyone realized at the time. But the journey has been useful, since we now have much better understanding of why assessment of achievement and curriculum mastery remains vital as a paradigm for admissions testing. Curriculum-based achievement tests are the fairest and most effective assessments for college admissions and have important incentive or “signaling effects” for our K-12 schools as well: They help reinforce a rigorous academic curriculum and create better alignment of teaching, learning, and assessment all along the pathway from high school to college.},

Our analyses of a large national sample show that, when pooled within-high-school analyses are applied, high school grades and class rank have larger correlations with family income and education than is evident in the results of typical analyses, and {SAT} scores have smaller associations with socioeconomic factors. {SAT} scores and high school grades, therefore, have more similar associations with {SES} than they do when only the usual across-high-school correlations are considered.},

Low-income students who took the new exam received higher scores and attended better colleges, but they had lower earnings after college.

	abstract = {A distinguishing feature of recent changes to the {US} system of public assistance is its increasing focus on working families and reliance on the tax system to transfer dollars to needy families. After a decade in near total obscurity, the earned income tax credit ({EITC}) was expanded to become the largest cash-transfer program for lower-income families with children. Advocates of the {EITC} argue that, unlike traditional welfare, the credit helps “promote both the values of family and work”. Indeed, empirical evidence consistent with economic theory suggests that the {EITC} promotes employment among eligible unmarried women with children. To target benefits to lower-income families, however, the {EITC} is based on family income, leading to traditional welfare-type disincentives for most eligible secondary earners. In fact, the {EITC} is likely to reduce overall family labor supply among married couples. This paper examines the labor force participation response of married couples to {EITC} expansions between 1984 and 1996. The effect of the credit is estimated using both quasi-experimental and traditional reduced-form labor supply models. Results from both models show the same qualitative conclusion, that the {EITC} expansions reduced total family labor supply of married couples. In all cases, we find a decline in labor force participation by married women that more than offsets any rise in participation by their spouses. While the labor force participation rate of married men increased by about 0.2 percentage points, that of married women decreased by just over a full percentage point. These aggregate effects mask substantial heterogeneity in the population. Women facing the strongest disincentives were more than 2 percentage points less likely to work after the expansions. These findings imply that the {EITC} is effectively subsidizing married mothers to stay home, and therefore, have implications for the design of the program.},

On average, husbands reduced labor supply by about the equivalent of two weeks of full-time employment.

Youth reduced labor supply by about the equivalent of four weeks of full-time employment. Estimated income and substitution effects are quite similar to those obtained from nonexperimental studies.},

Son principal argument porte sur la distinction nécessaire, et souvent négligée, entre « inégalité des revenus », ou des résultats, et « inégalité des chances » comme frein au développement. Les justifications théoriques d’une relation négative entre développement et inégalité suggèrent que ce n’est pas l’inégalité des résultats, revenu ou consommation, qui est un frein au développement. Ce sont d’autres dimensions, plus fondamentales, de l’inégalités économique et sociale, comme les différences dans les familles ou les milieux sociaux d’origine, dans l’accès à l’éducation, aux soins de santé, au crédit, à la sécurité ou à la justice, ou encore la discriminations à l’égard de certains groupes ethniques ou des femmes. Il se trouve que l’inégalité des revenus sur laquelle se concentre presqu’exclusivement la littérature empirique sur inégalité et développement n’est qu’un marqueur très imparfait de cette définition plus générale de l’inégalité, qui correspond à l’« inégalité des chances ». Mais en même temps, et de façon paradoxale, corriger ces dimensions de l’inégalité requiert le plus souvent des politiques impliquant une certaine redistribution des revenus, bien que l’inégalité des revenus soit plutôt une conséquence que la principale cause des inégalités qui compromettent le développement.},

However, their potential disincentive effects on beneficiaries' labor supply have spurred a heated policy debate.

Yet, we find that an expansion of Bolsa Familia increased local formal employment, using variation in the size of the reform across municipalities. The evidence is consistent with multiplier effects of cash transfers in the local economy, which dominate potential negative effects on formal labor supply among beneficiaries.},

For some purposes, such as estimating the marginal cost of funds, and subject to some qualifications, the nature of the behavioral response does not matter, and only the total magnitude of response does. However, with respect to real behavioral responses such as labor supply, it is natural to presume that the response is an immutable function of preferences. With respect to avoidance and evasion, though, this is not appropriate because there are a variety of policy instruments that can affect the magnitude of responses, implying that the elasticity of response is itself a policy instrument.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have reported a disproportionate increase in reported incomes for high-income taxpayers following the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ({TRA} 86). Because marginal tax rates for this group were lowered substantially in {TRA} 86, several authors have concluded that reported incomes for this group are very responsive to changes in marginal tax rates. This paper examines similar evidence for the marginal tax rate increases of the 1990s. We tabulate recent cross-sectional and panel data to follow changes in reported incomes for the period 1989-95. The data suggest that there may have been a significant response to the rate increases as reported incomes for high-income taxpayers—especially income from wages and salaries—fell from 1992 to 1993 following the 1993 tax increase. The changes, however, may not be a permanent response to the tax rate changes, but may instead reflect a shift of income into 1992 in anticipation of the 1993 rate increases. By 1995, the decline in income for the highest-income group was completely recouped. We also find that there is significant heterogeneity in the response of taxpayers facing the same change in marginal tax rates. Thus, while the paper does not dismiss the potential for a permanent response to the recent rate increases, it does suggest that acrosstime comparisons, like those made here and previously for {TRA} 86, will not yield a stable relationship between marginal rates and reported incomes.},

This paper presents evidence that a substantial amount of income shifting has in fact occured since 1965, based on time-series regression analyses that reveal that an increase in corporate tax rates relative to personal rates resulted in an increase in reported personal income and a drop in reported corporate income, even after controlling for corproate use of debt finance and for the amount of corporate assets. We focus on one mechanism for shifting–changing the form of compensation for executives and other workers, such as between wage compensation and greater use of stock options. The potential importance of income shifting requires a reinterpretation of both the efficiency and distributional consequences of of changes in the tax structure.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.trb.2012.01.010},
	abstract = {Due to ever increasing travel demand, fiscal and environmental constraints, it is recognized that pure transport supply or pure demand management alone is not effective to mitigate traffic congestion. Developing integrated transport supply and demand management ({TS}–{DM}) strategies is crucial for ensuring sustainable urban development. {TS}–{DM} strategies will not only affect the transport system performance, but also induce changes in the land use pattern and hence changes in land value. Moreover, the implementation of {TS}–{DM} strategies typically involves a progressively phased schedule; one must account for the costs and effects that accrue over time. This paper develops a formulation to study the impact of {TS}–{DM} strategies on the overall system performance and activity location costs expressed as land value. Specifically, a nested multinomial logit model combined with the bid-rent process is formulated to model residents’ location and travel choices, with the problem of housing supply integrated in this framework. The overall combined network equilibrium problem is expressed as a non-linear complementarity problem. The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium solutions are investigated through an equivalent mathematical programming formulation. Moreover, analytical results are derived to study the distribution of benefits due to transport infrastructure improvement among different stakeholders for networks with one origin–destination ({OD}) pair, for scenarios of homogenous and heterogeneous values of time. The analytical results show that transport improvements benefit landowners or developers rather than tenants under the scenario of homogeneous value of time; and benefit people with a higher income more under the scenario of heterogeneous value of time. Finally, a mathematical program is developed to determine the optimal {TS}–{DM} strategies over time in order to optimize the overall system performance. For general networks with multiple {OD} pairs, where analytical results are not available, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effects of {TS}–{DM} strategies, which generally echo the analytical results developed for the case with one {OD} pair.},

	abstract = {Immigrants to the United States earn lower wages than native workers, and this gap decreases with time spent working in the {US} labor market. In this paper, we study the determinants of the wage path of immigrants in order to understand this wage gap between natives and immigrants. We focus on two particular explanations: differing returns to experience in the {US} and search frictions when finding optimal occupations. Labor market experience in the {US} may be more valuable for jobs in the {US} than labor market experience in other countries. In addition, it can take time for new immigrants to be matched with their optimal occupation after moving to the {US}. Separating these factors is difficult due to potential self-selection of immigrants. To deal with this, we use data from the New Immigrant Survey which has detailed information on the occupations and wages of immigrants both before they enter the {US} as well as repeated observations after moving to the {US}. Reduced form evidence shows that both search frictions and work experience affect immigrant wages. We develop and estimate a simple model of on-the-job human capital accumulation and job search. Using the estimated model, we simulate counterfactuals to understand the importance of each factor. In the first simulation, we find that immigrant wages over a lifetime increase by 32\% when returns to experience in the home country are the same as returns to experience in the {US}. In the second simulation, we match immigrants with their optimal occupation in their first {US} job, and find that this increases wages by 5\%.},

There is little evidence for differential wage responses to economic shocks.

Although immigrants initially earn less than the native born, their earnings rise more rapidly with U.S. labor market experience, and after 10 to 15 years their earnings equal, and then exceed, that of the native born. Earnings are unrelated to whether the foreign born are U.S. citizens.},

High rates of immigrant wage assimilation, in general, and relatively high wages of immigrant cohorts that arrived during the 1990s, in particular, can to a large extent be explained by a negative trend in unemployment in the data. Relating immigrant and native period effects to local labor market unemployment, we find that wage assimilation among lesser-educated immigrants is negligible. For high-school– and college-educated male immigrants, rates of wage assimilation during early years in the United States are procyclical, suggesting that rising unemployment slows accumulation of U.S.-specific human capital.},

Using the 1970 and 1980 U.S. censuses, this paper studies the earnings growth experienced by specific immigrant cohorts during the period 1970-80. It is found that within-cohort growth is significantly smaller than the growth predicted by cross-section regressions for most immigrant groups. This differential is consistent with the hypothesis that there has been a secular decline in the "quality" of immigrants admitted to the United States.},

A growing class of "place based" policies attempt to address these differences through public investments and subsidies that target disadvantaged neighborhoods, cities or regions. Place based policies have the potential to profoundly affect the location of economic activity, along with the wages, employment, and industry mix of communities. These programs are widespread in the U.S. and throughout the world, but have only recently been studied closely by economists. We consider the following questions: Who benefits from place based interventions? Do the national benefits outweigh the costs? What sorts of interventions are most likely to be effective?To study these questions, we develop a simple spatial equilibrium model designed to characterize the welfare effects of place based policies on the local and the national economy. Using this model, we critically evaluate the economic rationales for place based policies and assess the latest evidence on their effects. We conclude with some lessons for policy and directions for future research.},

	abstract = {I examine the causes and the consequences of diﬀerences in labor market outcomes across local labor markets within a country. The focus is on a long-run general equilibrium setting, where workers and ﬁrms are free to move across localities and local prices adjust to maintain the spatial equilibrium. In particular, I develop a tractable general equilibrium framework of local labor markets with heterogenous labor. This framework is useful in thinking about diﬀerences in labor market outcomes of diﬀerent skill groups across locations. It clariﬁes how, in spatial equilibrium, localized shocks to a part of the labor market propagate to the rest of the economy through changes in employment, wages and local prices and how this diﬀusion aﬀects workers’ welfare. Using this framework, I address three related questions. First, I analyze the welfare consequences of productivity diﬀerences across local labor markets. I seek to understand what happens to the wage, employment and utility of workers with diﬀerent skill levels when a local economy experiences a shift in the productivity of a group of workers. Second, I analyze the causes of productivity diﬀerences across local labor markets. To a large extent, productivity diﬀerences within a country are unlikely to be exogenous. I review the theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration economies, with a particular focus on studies that are relevant for labor economists. Finally, I discuss the implications for policy.},

These aspects of the grand gender convergence are figurative chapters in a history of gender roles. But what must the “last” chapter contain for there to be equality in the labor market? The answer may come as a surprise. The solution does not (necessarily) have to involve government intervention and it need not make men more responsible in the home (although that wouldn't hurt). But it must involve changes in the labor market, especially how jobs are structured and remunerated to enhance temporal flexibility. The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours. Such change has taken off in various sectors, such as technology, science, and health, but is less apparent in the corporate, financial, and legal worlds. ({JEL} J3, J16, J22, J24, J31, J33, N3)},

	abstract = {A recent “revisionist” literature characterizes the pronounced rise in U.S. wage inequality since 1980 as an “episodic” event of the ﬁrst half of the 1980s driven by nonmarket factors (particularly a falling real minimum wage) and concludes that continued increases in wage inequality since the late 1980s substantially reﬂect the mechanical confounding effects of changes in labor force composition. Analyzing data from the Current Population Survey for 1963 to 2005, we ﬁnd limited support for these claims. The slowing of the growth of overall wage inequality in the 1990s hides a divergence in the paths of upper-tail (90/50) inequality—which has increased steadily since 1980, even adjusting for changes in labor force composition—and lower-tail (50/10) inequality, which rose sharply in the ﬁrst half of the 1980s and plateaued or contracted thereafter. Fluctuations in the real minimum wage are not a plausible explanation for these trends since the bulk of inequality growth occurs above the median of the wage distribution. Models emphasizing rapid secular growth in the relative demand for skills—attributable to skill-biased technical change—and a sharp deceleration in the relative supply of college workers in the 1980s do an excellent job of capturing the evolution of the college/high school wage premium over four decades. But these models also imply a puzzling deceleration in relative demand growth for college workers in the early 1990s, also visible in a recent “polarization” of skill demands in which employment has expanded in high-wage and low-wage work at the expense of middle-wage jobs. These patterns are potentially reconciled by a modiﬁed version of the skill-biased technical change hypothesis that emphasizes the role of information technology in complementing abstract (high-education) tasks and substituting for routine (middle-education) tasks.},

Using data from the Chicago public schools, we estimate that serious cases of teacher or administrator cheating on standardized tests occur in a minimum of 4–5 percent of elementary school classrooms annually. The observed frequency of cheating appears to respond strongly to relatively minor changes in incentives. Our results highlight the fact that high-powered incentive systems, especially those with bright line rules, may induce unexpected behavioral distortions such as cheating. Statistical analysis, however, may provide a means of detecting illicit acts, despite the best attempts of perpetrators to keep them clandestine.},

Using U.S. Census data, I estimate a spatial equilibrium model where labour differs by skill level, gender, and nativity. Workers are heterogeneous in city preferences. Cities vary in productivity levels, housing prices, and amenities. I use the estimated model to assess the distributional consequences of several immigration policies. The results show that a skill selective immigration policy leads to welfare gains for low skill workers, but welfare losses for high skill workers. The negative impacts are more substantial among the incumbent high skill immigrants. Internal migration mitigates the initial negative impacts, particularity in cities where housing supplies are inelastic. However, the negative wage impacts on some workers intensify. This is because an out-migration of workers of a given type may raise the local wages for workers of that type, while reducing the local wages of workers with complementary characteristics. Overall, there are substantial variations in the welfare effects of immigration across and within cities. Further, I use the model to assess the welfare effects of the border wall between Mexico and the U.S. The results show that the potential benefits are significantly smaller than the proposed cost of construction.},

In the first step we use labor demand functions to estimate the elasticity of substitution across different groups of workers. Second, we use the underlying production structure and the estimated elasticities to calculate the total wage effects of immigration in the long run. We emphasize that a production function framework is needed to combine own-group effects with cross-group effects in order to obtain the total wage effects for each native group. In order to obtain a parsimonious representation of elasticities that can be estimated with available data, we adopt alternative nested-{CES} models and let the data select the preferred specification. New to this paper is the estimate of the substitutability between natives and immigrants of similar education and experience levels. In the data-preferred model, there is a small but significant degree of imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants which, when combined with the other estimated elasticities, implies that in the period from 1990 to 2006 immigration had a small effect on the wages of native workers with no high school degree (between 0.6\% and +1.7\%). It also had a small positive effect on average native wages (+0.6\%) and a substantial negative effect (−6.7\%) on wages of previous immigrants in the long run.},

The existing studies typically exploit the geographic clustering of immigrants and use differences across local labor markets to identify the impact. This approach has not been successful because it ignores the strong currents that tend to equalize economic conditions across regions. My analysis is based on the notion that increases in labor supply in a finely-detailed skill group should affect the earnings and employment opportunities of that group. I use a key insight of human capital theory to define the skill groups: a worker acquires skills both in school and on the job. The comparison of labor market outcomes across these skill groups suggests that immigration has indeed harmed the earnings and employment opportunities of competing native workers. An immigrant influx that increases the supply of workers in a particular schoolingexperience group by 10 percent lowers the wage of natives in that group by 3 to 4 percent, and reduces weeks worked by 2 to 3 percent.},

We exploit the random assignment of college students to professors in a large body of required coursework to examine how professor quality affects student achievement. Introductory course professors significantly affect student achievement in contemporaneous and follow-on related courses, but the effects are quite heterogeneous across subjects. Students of professors who as a group perform well in the initial mathematics course perform significantly worse in follow-on related math, science, and engineering courses. We find that the academic rank, teaching experience, and terminal degree status of mathematics and science professors are negatively correlated with contemporaneous student achievement, but positively related to follow-on course achievement. Across all subjects, student evaluations of professors are positive predictors of contemporaneous course achievement, but are poor predictors of follow-on course achievement.},

To begin, we present a simple model of student learning that incorporates permanent as well as transitory learning gains. Using this model, we demonstrate how the parameter of interest - the persistence of a particular measurable education input - can be recovered via instrumental variables as a particular local average treatment effect. We initially motivate this strategy in the context of teacher quality, but then generalize the model to consider educational interventions more generally. Using administrative data that links students and teachers, we construct measures of teacher effectiveness and then estimate the persistence of these teacher value-added measures on student test scores. We find that teacher-induced gains in math and reading achievement quickly erode. In most cases, our point estimates suggest a one-year persistence of about one-fifth and rule out a one-year persistence rate higher than one-third.},

            The labor market increasingly rewards social skills. Between 1980 and 2012, jobs requiring high levels of social interaction grew by nearly 12 percentage points as a share of the U.S. labor force. Math-intensive but less social jobs—including many {STEM} occupations—shrank by 3.3 percentage points over the same period. Employment and wage growth were particularly strong for jobs requiring high levels of both math skill and social skills. To understand these patterns, I develop a model of team production where workers “trade tasks” to exploit their comparative advantage. In the model, social skills reduce coordination costs, allowing workers to specialize and work together more efficiently. The model generates predictions about sorting and the relative returns to skill across occupations, which I investigate using data from the {NLSY}79 and the {NLSY}97. Using a comparable set of skill measures and covariates across survey waves, I find that the labor market return to social skills was much greater in the 2000s than in the mid-1980s and 1990s.},

	abstract = {Over the past four decades, empirical researchers -- many of them economists -- have accumulated an impressive amount of evidence on teachers. In this paper, we ask what the existing evidence implies for how school leaders might recruit, evaluate, and retain teachers. We begin by summarizing the evidence on five key points, referring to existing work and to evidence we have accumulated from our research with the nation's two largest school districts: Los Angeles and New York City. First, teachers display considerable heterogeneity in their effects on student achievement gains. Second, estimates of teacher effectiveness based on student achievement data are noisy measures. Third, teachers' effectiveness rises rapidly in the first year or two of their teaching careers but then quickly levels out. Fourth, the primary cost of teacher turnover is not the direct cost of hiring and firing, but rather is the loss to students who will be taught by a novice teacher rather than one with several years of experience. Fifth, it is difficult to identify at the time of hire those teachers who will prove more effective. As a result, better teachers can only be identified after some evidence on their actual job performance has accumulated. We then explore what these facts imply for how principals and school districts should act, using a simple model in which schools must search for teachers using noisy signals of teacher effectiveness. The implications of our analysis are strikingly different from current practice. Rather than screening at the time of hire, the evidence on heterogeneity of teacher performance suggests a better strategy would be identifying large differences between teachers by observing the first few years of teaching performance and retaining only the highest-performing teachers.},

Implicit in the {VAM} approach are strong assumptions about the nature of the educational production function and the assignment of students to classrooms. In this paper, I develop falsification tests for three widely used {VAM} specifications, based on the idea that future teachers cannot influence students' past achievement. In data from North Carolina, each of the {VAMs}' exclusion restrictions is dramatically violated. In particular, these models indicate large “effects” of fifth grade teachers on fourth grade test score gains. I also find that conventional measures of individual teachers' value added fade out very quickly and are at best weakly related to long-run effects.

To extend this literature, we administered an in-depth survey to new math teachers in New York City and collected information on a number of nontraditional predictors of effectiveness, including teaching-specific content knowledge, cognitive ability, personality traits, feelings of self-efficacy, and scores on a commercially available teacher selection instrument. We find that only a few of these predictors have statistically significant relationships with student and teacher outcomes. However, the individual variables load onto two factors, which measure what one might describe as teachers' cognitive and noncognitive skills. We find that both factors have a moderately large and statistically significant relationship with student and teacher outcomes, particularly with student test scores.},

Unique matched panel data from the {UTD} Texas Schools Project permit the identification of teacher quality based on student performance along with the impact of specific, measured components of teachers and schools. Semiparametric lower bound estimates of the variance in teacher quality based entirely on within-school heterogeneity indicate that teachers have powerful effects on reading and mathematics achievement, though little of the variation in teacher quality is explained by observable characteristics such as education or experience. The results suggest that the effects of a costly ten student reduction in class size are smaller than the benefit of moving one standard deviation up the teacher quality distribution, highlighting the importance of teacher effectiveness in the determination of school quality.},

	abstract = {This chapter analyzes the design of incentive schemes in education while reviewing empirical studies that evaluate performance pay programs for educators. Several themes emerge. First, education officials should not use one assessment system to create both educator performance metrics and measures of student achievement. To mitigate incentives for coaching, incentive systems should employ assessments that vary in both format and item content. Separate no-stakes assessments provide more reliable information about student achievement because they create no incentives for educators to take hidden actions that contaminate student test scores. Second, relative performance schemes are too rare in education. These schemes are more difficult to manipulate than systems built around psychometric or subjective performance standards. Third, assessment-based incentive schemes are mechanisms that complement rather than substitute for systems that promote parental choice, e.g. vouchers and charter schools.},

Decisions to attend school seem subject to peer effects and time-inconsistent preferences. Merit scholarships, school health programs, and information about returns to education can all cost-effectively spur school participation. However, distortions in education systems, such as weak teacher incentives and elite-oriented curricula, undermine learning in school and much of the impact of increasing existing educational spending. Pedagogical innovations designed to address these distortions (such as technology-assisted instruction, remedial education, and tracking by achievement) can raise test scores at a low cost. Merely informing parents about school conditions seems insufficient to improve teacher incentives, and evidence on merit pay is mixed, but hiring teachers locally on short-term contracts can save money and improve educational outcomes. School vouchers can cost-effectively increase both school participation and learning.},

	shorttitle = {Gathering Feedback for Teaching},
	abstract = {There is a growing consensus that teacher evaluation in the United States is fundamentally broken. Few would argue that a system that tells 98 percent of teachers they are "satisfactory" benefits anyone--including teachers. The nation's collective failure to invest in high-quality professional feedback to teachers is inconsistent with decades of research reporting large disparities in student learning gains in different teachers' classrooms (even within the same schools). Many states and school districts are looking to reinvent the way they do teacher evaluation and feedback, and they want better tools. With the help of nearly 3,000 teacher-volunteers, the Measures of Effective Teaching ({MET}) project is evaluating alternative ways to provide valid and reliable feedback to teachers for professional development and improvement. In this report, the authors focus on the value of classroom observations. They test five different approaches to classroom observations. Each observation instrument is designed to do two things: (1) focus an observer's attention on specific aspects of teaching practice and (2) establish common evidentiary standards for each level of practice. In this report, the authors investigate the properties of the following five instruments: (1) Framework for Teaching (or {FFT}, developed by Charlotte Danielson of the Danielson Group); (2) Classroom Assessment Scoring System (or {CLASS}, developed by Robert Pianta, Karen La Paro, and Bridget Hamre at the University of Virginia); (3) Protocol for Language Arts Teaching Observations (or {PLATO}, developed by Pam Grossman at Stanford University); (4) Mathematical Quality of Instruction (or {MQI}, developed by Heather Hill of Harvard University); and (5) {UTeach} Teacher Observation Protocol (or {UTOP}, developed by Michael Marder and Candace Walkington at the University of Texas-Austin). Appended are: (1) Sample Restrictions Leading to Video Sample; and (2) Regression Coefficients Used for Criterion-Based Weighting.

However, among those with the same experience and certification status, there are large and persistent differences in teacher effectiveness. Such evidence suggests that classroom performance during the first two years is a more reliable indicator of a teacher's future effectiveness. We also evaluate turnover among teachers by initial certification status, and the implied impact on student achievement of hiring teachers with predictably high turnover. Given modest estimates of the payoff to experience, even high turnover groups (such as Teach for America participants) would have to be only slightly more effective in each year to offset the negative effects of their high exit rates (I2, J24).},

This paper examines studies published between 1990 and 2010, in both the education literature and the economics literature, to investigate which specific school and teacher characteristics, if any, appear to have strong positive impacts on learning and time in school. Starting with over 9,000 studies, 79 are selected as being of sufficient quality. Then an even higher bar is set in terms of econometric methods used, leaving 43 "high quality" studies. Finally, results are also shown separately for 13 randomized trials. The estimated impacts on time in school and learning of most school and teacher characteristics are statistically insignificant, especially when the evidence is limited to the "high quality" studies. The few variables that do have significant effects - e.g. availability of desks, teacher knowledge of the subjects they teach, and teacher absence - are not particularly surprising and thus provide little guidance for future policies and programs.},

Regions with weaker enforcement experienced opposite effects. All these effects are concentrated on low-skill workers.

	title = {Job Referrals and Strategic Network Formation},
	abstract = {In this paper, I study the behavioural motivations underlying job referral decisions. In a ﬁeld experiment in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, I show that when choosing who to refer for a job, individuals trade off personal beneﬁts and altruistic considerations, with important implications for the efﬁciency and equity of the referral process. Using complete data on urban social networks and generating a panel of real work and referral opportunities over multiple sessions, I ﬁrst show that workers rely on reciprocity. This leads to both signiﬁcant on-the-job productivity losses and persistence in the exclusion of less connected individuals. This dynamic reciprocity is reduced under incentivised referrals, where workers are paid according to the output of their referral, which makes them screen more productive workers. Second, I ﬁnd that peripheral workers use job referrals strategically to enlarge their network: they are more likely to establish new and reciprocated links, with connections persisting after 18 months. I show that these ﬁndings are consistent with a network-based job referral model where individuals trade off social payoffs and altruistic considerations. My ﬁndings suggest that conventional job referrals through social networks can reinforce labour market inequalities and prevent less socially connected individuals from getting access to jobs. However, when given referral opportunities, these individuals can manage to escape exclusion even in the long-run. Policy-makers could exploit this and provide subsidised temporary jobs as linking opportunities, with the goal of alleviating long-term youth unemployment.},

For economies with significant informal sectors, business cycle fluctuations and labor market policy interventions can have important effects not only on the unemployment rate, but also on the allocation of workers across regulated and unregulated jobs. In this paper, using worker flows data from Brazil, we build, calibrate, and simulate a two-sector search and matching labor market model, in which firms have the choice of hiring workers formally or informally. We show that our model can explain well the main cyclical patterns that lead to those cyclical reallocations. We also show how the effect of government interventions in the labor market depend on the magnitude of the reallocation of labor across regulated and unregulated sectors. For our calibration, policies that decrease the cost of formal jobs, or increase the cost of informality, raise the share of formal employment while reducing unemployment.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the economic literature on informality, its causes and consequences for development. It covers a comprehensive body of research that ranges from well-identiﬁed experimental studies to equilibrium macro models, and more recently includes structural models that integrate both micro and macro eﬀects. The results available in the literature indicate that lowering the costs of formality is not an effective policy to reduce informality but may generate positive aggregate eﬀects, such as higher output and {TFP}. The most eﬀective formalisation policy is to increase enforcement on the extensive margin but not on the intensive margin of informality. The former generates substantial gains in aggregate {TFP} and output, without necessarily increasing unemployment. However, the overall welfare impacts are likely to depend on the transitional dynamics between steady states, which remains as an open area for future research.},

	abstract = {We show that helping young job seekers signal their skills to employers generates large and persistent improvements in their labour market outcomes. We do this by comparing an intervention that improves the ability to signal skills (the “job application workshop”) to a transport subsidy treatment designed to reduce the cost of job search. In the short run, both interventions have large positive effects on the probability of finding a formal job. The workshop also increases the probability of having a stable job with an open-ended contract. Four years later, the workshop significantly increases earnings, job satisfaction, and employment duration, but the effects of the transport subsidy have dissipated. Gains are concentrated on individuals who generally have worse labour market outcomes. Overall, our findings highlight that young people possess valuable skills that are unobservable to employers. Making these skills observable generates earnings gains that are far greater than the cost of the intervention.},

How much does education raise wages? Mostly Harmless Econometrics shows how the basic tools of applied econometrics allow the data to speak.},
